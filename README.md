# automationhacks/ama

## Why

A repository to ask [@automationhacks](https://twitter.com/automationhacks) anything.

I [work at Gojek](https://automationhacks.io/about/) as a Manager, SDET, I've [written extensively on Test automation, Testing and Quality at my blog](https://automationhacks.io/) and have [spoken](https://automationhacks.io/talks/) about Appium, Selenium and backend automation at some prominent conferences. If you have a question you're interested in knowing my thoughts about, then this is just the joint for you.

Also, This would be helpful to create a breadcrumb trail of such questions which I can always point new and aspiring test automation journeymen's to and maybe refer myself lest this information gets lost in a sea of twitter/blog feeds 😀

### Ask a question 🗣👩🏻‍💻

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/automationhacks/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/automationhacks/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter
